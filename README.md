# signup1
1.First, we create a basic HTML file for the signup page. 

Once we  have a GitHub account, we can create a new repository for your signup page:

Log in to your GitHub account.
Click on the 'Pluse' sign at the top right corner and select "New Repository."
Fill in the repository name, description, and other settings as needed.
Choose the visibility (public or private) for your repository.
Click on the "Create repository" button.

Next, we need to push your signup page code to the GitHub repository:

Open a terminal or command prompt on our computer.

cd /path/to/your/signup-page-directory

Initialize a Git repository in our project directory by running:
git init

Add your files to the Git repository
git add .


Once we've completed these steps, we signup page code will be uploaded to your GitHub repository.

Now, we can access your signup page on GitHub by visiting https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.
